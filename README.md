# üõí Highly Available E-Commerce Infrastructure on AWS

This project demonstrates how to design and deploy a **highly available infrastructure** for an e-commerce application using **AWS CloudFormation**. It uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to create a secure, scalable, and resilient cloud architecture ‚Äî perfect for learning and portfolio building.

---

## üìå Key Features

- üß± VPC with public and private subnets across **multiple availability zones**
- üåê Internet Gateway, Route Tables, and proper routing setup
- üíª **EC2 instance** in public subnet, with SSH and HTTP access
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Apache Web Server** installed automatically
- ‚òÅÔ∏è All resources deployed using a **single CloudFormation YAML template**
- üßπ Resources deleted after use to prevent AWS charges

## üöÄ How to Use This Project

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This guide assumes you're using a MacBook Air and have already configured:
> - AWS CLI
> - Git + GitHub
> - SSH Key Pair
> - IAM User with Admin access

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/high-availability-ecommerce-aws.git
cd high-availability-ecommerce-aws
```

### 2. Deploy the Infrastructure

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name ecommerce-stack \
  --template-body file://infrastructure.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

### 3. Wait Until Stack Status Is `CREATE_COMPLETE`

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name ecommerce-stack \
  --query "Stacks[0].StackStatus"
```

### 4. SSH Into EC2 Instance

```bash
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
```

> Apache will be installed automatically. You can visit:  
> `http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>` in your browser to see the web page.

### 5. Take Screenshots for Your Portfolio

- `public ip.png` ‚Äî EC2 Public IP from AWS Console
- `public ip 1.png` ‚Äî Webpage running Apache in browser

### 6. Delete the Stack to Avoid Charges

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ecommerce-stack
```

## üìö Learning Outcomes

- ‚úÖ Created complete AWS architecture using YAML
- ‚úÖ Understood networking: subnets, route tables, gateways
- ‚úÖ Practiced deploying and deleting infrastructure using CLI
- ‚úÖ Gained real-world experience using CloudFormation
- ‚úÖ Showcased project on GitHub with documentation and screenshots

---

## üí° Cost-Saving Note

> All AWS resources were **destroyed after testing** to prevent unexpected charges. Always delete unused stacks in AWS when done.
